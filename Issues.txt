The most widely used simple media players are VLC and Windows Media Player. 
The problem with these are they are lacking essential features. VLC's playlist does not
allow one to tag or rate tracks and is unintuitive to use. The interface and skins
are also said be unaesthetic. Windows Media Player supports only MP3 and Windows formats and has limited
options for sound quality. With our application we will aim to rectify these issues producing a Media Player
that's easy to use, supports a wide variety of formats and is visually pleasing.
